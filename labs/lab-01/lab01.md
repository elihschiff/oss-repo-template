#### Question 1 (Open Source Definition)

Having a clear set of 10 rules for open source is important because it sets a standard that is clear and easy to understand. Part of the purpose of open source is to make software accessible to everyone. Having simple and clear rules means you dont need a lawyer to understand and it makes it easier for everyday developers to get involved.

#### Question 3 (Smart Questions)
1. It is usually a good idea to make sure that the person you are asking your question to understands your question. Sometimes you need to rephrase your question so that they can better understand it.
2. Splitting up a large question into smaller more manageable questions can help the other person understand it and provide relevant answers without getting confused.


#### Question 4 (Free Culture)
What sticks out to me is how the narrative gets spun by the different groups involved. The RIAA does not care that they are spinning the story, and in the process hurting Jesse. He had no intention of helping pirates and he was not even a pirate himself. Yet that did not seem to matter. Even RPI currently seems to spin this story as if Jesse was a pirate. When we were in orientation, RPI told us this story. But the way RPI told it, there was an RPI student who pirated a lot of music and got caught. Nowhere did they mention that in fact all he did was make a free tool to help other students find files. And in the process he uncovered piracy. It is easy to at first hear a story from one side and think they are correct, which is why often listing to multiple sources is a good idea to get the full picture.

#### Question 3
I want to evaluate [umami](https://github.com/mikecao/umami) an analytics platform focused on privacy. Most websites use something like Google Analytics because it is free (as in cost) and extremely feature rich. However, every website that uses it is taking part in helping google track their users across the internet as a whole. As somebody who believes in privacy, and as a user of umami myself, I want to learn more about how their code works and even possibly help with development. It is a web based and uses javascript which is a language I am familiar with. In addition, it also uses technologies like docker which I dont know anything about, but we will be covering in OSS this semester.
